## About The Project

This is a basic password generator that generates a unique password each time, based on the user's customizations for length and whether they want to include numbers or special characters. I learned to create this project during my learning from the Chai-aur-react series by Hitesh Choudhary sir on the Chai Aur Code YouTube channel.
